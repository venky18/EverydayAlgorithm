/**
 * Really hard and elegant problem, not in terms of coding but in terms of how to come up with a clean recursive solution.
 * My general approach is that for every decision making: I will win when there is a choice that
 * makes sure that I will win. I will lose, when for every choice, my opponent will have some way to
 * make sure he/she wins by making the right choice next time.
 * Winning is related to the number of possible divisions that can happen on this number: if the number of possible divisions
 * is odd, then the current player wins; if even, his/her opponent wins. So I just care about whether
 * the number of divisions can be odd.
 *
 * ANECDOTE:
 * It is like that I take a number, I try all ways of division at my point and then throw the results to my
 * opponent, asking "can you win by this?" If my opponent say "Yes!" I am sad and silently go to try
 * the next one. If he crys "No", I will be happy and announce my victory in front of the whole world.
 * (or to my opponent if this is not the decisive victory yet. But it is good to make them feel bad, or low in morale, right?)
 * If I run out of possible choices and for all of my choices, my opponent always say "Yes!", I will surrender and yell at them "it is not a
 * fair game!!!"
